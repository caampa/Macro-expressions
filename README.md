# Emotion Recognition based on Facial  Expressions

## Abstract 
 
Detecting   expressions   in   people’s   faces   is   highly   demanded   in   computer   vision   fields,   due   to   its   several   useful   applications.   Notorious   psychologists   differentiated   between   two   types   of   facial  expressions:   macro-expressions   which   can   be   easily   perceived   by   a   human   eye,   and  micro-expressions   which   on   the   contrary,   only   an   expert   eye   could   detect   given   their   limited   duration.   This   project   aims   to   develop   a  system   capable   of   detecting   seven   possible macro-expressions   (Anger,   Happiness,   Sadness,   Fear,   Surprise,   Neutral   and   Disgust)   just   by looking   at   people’s   faces   in   real   time   streams.   In   order   to   accomplish   that,   several state-of-the-art   techniques   will   be   studied   and   analyzed,   along   with   different   preprocessing techniques to cope with images or videos obtained in uncontrolled situations.
